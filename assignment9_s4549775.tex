\subsection{Abstract}
The abstract mentions the main achievement of the research, passing the Turin Test. It also nicely sums up the contents of the article.

\subsection{Introduction}
You almost literally copied the introduction from exercise 6 and did not incorporate the feedback from exercise 7 yet. The same feedback I gave still applies. I have not processed your feedback either, we should both do so in exercise 10.

Additionally, the beginnings of your abstract and introduction contain the same information just worded differently. I had problems with this too. After reading the abstract, reading the first sentences of your introduction just feels like reading it again.
